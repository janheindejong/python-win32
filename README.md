# Introduction
This repository contains images with the 32-bit version of Python, on Windows Servercore base images.

Although the 32-bit Python is the default installation for Python on Windows, the official Python Docker repository doesn't provide images with this setup. Usually, it doesn't make a big difference, but in some cases - for example when freezing your code with applications like PyInstaller - the 64-bit Python might give you some headaches.

I'll update them whenever a new stable Python release becomes available.
