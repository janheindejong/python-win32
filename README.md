# Introduction 
This repo contains dockerfiles for docker images containing Python 32-bit 
on Windows Servercore. 

I started this, because official Docker Python images don't offer the option to 
run Python 32-bit, which can be usefull in some cases (e.g. when compiling your 
code into Windows executables).
